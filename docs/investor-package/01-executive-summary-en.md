## Problem: Centralization is Killing AI Innovation

The artificial intelligence industry is experiencing a centralization crisis. Three tech giants—Amazon, Microsoft, and Google—control 66% of the global cloud AI infrastructure market worth $500+ billion. This monopoly creates five critical problems that stifle innovation and limit access to AI technologies.

**High cost of compute.** Training GPT-3 cost $4.6 million, GPT-4 over $100 million. Inference for ChatGPT costs OpenAI $700,000 per day or $255 million annually. Small and medium businesses cannot afford such expenses, creating an insurmountable barrier to entry in the AI market.

**Shortage of computational resources.** In 2023-2025, wait times for NVIDIA H100 access reached 6-12 months. Large tech companies bought up all available supply, leaving startups without resources. While the situation has improved, the structural problem of centralization remains.

**Privacy and data security.** Companies are forced to send confidential data to Amazon, Microsoft, or Google clouds, losing control over intellectual property. 73% of enterprise clients cite data privacy as the main barrier to AI adoption.

**Vendor lock-in.** Migration between cloud providers costs 20-30% of annual infrastructure budget. Companies become hostages to their choice, and providers arbitrarily raise prices.

**Geographic centralization.** Data centers are concentrated in the US, Europe, and China. Latency for users in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia reaches 200-500ms, making real-time AI applications impossible.

The market desperately needs a decentralized alternative that democratizes access to AI compute, reduces costs, and returns data control to users.

## Solution: First Mobile-First Decentralized AI Network

DAUR-AI creates a global decentralized network for AI computations using the computational power of millions of smartphones. Instead of building expensive data centers, we transform 6.8 billion existing mobile devices into a distributed supercomputer.

**Architecture.** Three-tier system: (1) mobile devices execute AI tasks, (2) backend servers coordinate distribution and result aggregation, (3) TON blockchain ensures transparent settlements and proof-of-computation. All data is encrypted end-to-end at the protocol level.

**Reverse AI — patentable innovation.** Unlike the traditional approach (task → solution), Reverse AI receives the final result and works backward, determining optimal methods and sequence of steps. This provides 40% savings in computational resources and 30% reduction in latency.

**Economic model.** Smartphone owners earn tokens for providing computational power. Developers and companies pay for network access through API, enterprise licenses, or capacity rental. Fair value distribution among all ecosystem participants.

**Scalability.** 5,000 mobile nodes = 10 PetaFLOPS (typical enterprise AI cluster worth $300K+). 128,000 nodes = NVIDIA DGX H100 ($7.68M). 1,000,000 nodes = 2 ExaFLOPS (comparable to top supercomputers). Organic growth through adoption, zero CapEx for expansion.

## Market: $500B+ TAM with Exponential Growth

**Total Addressable Market (TAM): $500B+**

We attack three overlapping markets with a combined volume of over $500 billion and 20-30% CAGR.

**AI Infrastructure ($26B → $500B by 2034).** The AI infrastructure market is valued at $26.18 billion in 2025 and projected to grow at 23.80% CAGR through 2034. Key drivers: exponential demand for computational power for training and inference of AI models, data center expansion ($7 trillion investment by 2030), mass adoption of generative AI in the corporate sector.

**Cloud Computing ($600B → $2.4T by 2030).** The global cloud computing market reached $600 billion in 2025 with projected 15-20% CAGR. AI workloads are becoming the dominant segment, overtaking traditional enterprise applications. Decentralized cloud is the fastest-growing segment with 35%+ CAGR.

**Blockchain & Web3 ($2T+ market cap).** The blockchain industry reached $2+ trillion market cap at peak moments in 2025. TON (The Open Network), integrated with Telegram (900+ million users), represents an ideal platform for mass adoption.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $150B**

We focus on three segments:

**AI-as-a-Service ($50B).** Companies using cloud AI APIs for inference, training, and data processing. Our target clients: AI startups, SaaS companies, enterprises with AI workloads.

**GPU Rental ($34B by 2032).** The GPU rental market is growing at 42% CAGR from $3.34 billion in 2023 to $33.91 billion by 2032. Decentralized alternative to AWS/GCP with 50-75% cost advantage.

**Federated Learning & Edge AI ($65B by 2030).** The federated learning and edge computing market is growing at 28% CAGR. Healthcare, finance, IoT require data processing without centralization.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $5.5M → $1.9B**

Realistic market capture forecast:
- 2026: $5.5M (0.004% SAM) — early adopters, pilot projects
- 2027: $51M (0.034% SAM) — enterprise traction
- 2028: $300M (0.2% SAM) — mainstream adoption
- 2029: $950M (0.63% SAM) — market leadership
- 2030: $1.9B (1.27% SAM) — dominant player

## Risks and Mitigation

**Technology Risks**

*Risk:* Mobile devices insufficient for AI tasks.  
*Mitigation:* Modern flagships (iPhone 15 Pro, Samsung S24) have 2+ TFLOPS GPU and 30+ TOPS NPU. Sufficient for inference of most models. Reverse AI optimizes resource usage.

*Risk:* Network latency too high.  
*Mitigation:* Geographic distribution of nodes provides edge computing. Latency 50-150ms vs 200-500ms for centralized data centers in remote regions.

**Market Risks**

*Risk:* AWS/GCP/Azure dominance.  
*Mitigation:* 50-75% cost advantage. Enterprise clients actively seeking alternatives due to vendor lock-in and high prices. Multi-cloud strategy becoming standard.

*Risk:* Slow adoption of decentralized solutions.  
*Mitigation:* TON integration provides access to 900M Telegram users. Developer-first approach: simple API, SDK, documentation. Enterprise sales team for B2B.

**Regulatory Risks**

*Risk:* Cryptocurrency and AI regulation.  
*Mitigation:* Daur Finance Limited registered in UK with transparent structure. GDPR, KYC/AML compliance. Working with regulators at early stages.

**Competitive Risks**

*Risk:* Model copying by major players.  
*Mitigation:* Reverse AI is patentable technology. Network effects create moat. First-mover advantage in mobile-first decentralized AI.
