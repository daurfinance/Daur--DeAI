# Daur-AI: Whitepaper

**Version 1.0 - October 4, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Daur-AI is a decentralized artificial intelligence network built on the TON blockchain. Our mission is to democratize access to AI computing, allowing anyone in the world to contribute to AI development and receive rewards by utilizing the power of their mobile devices. By transforming billions of smartphones into nodes of a global intelligence network, we aim to create a more accessible, efficient, and equitable AI ecosystem.

## 2. Market Overview

The global artificial intelligence market is experiencing explosive growth, with current valuations and projections highlighting the immense opportunity:

- **Current Market Size**: $638.23 billion in 2025 [1]
- **Projected Growth**: Expected to reach $3,680.47 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 19.20% [1]
- **Decentralized Computing Market**: Currently valued at $13.54 billion, projected to reach $50 billion by 2035 [2]

Despite this growth, significant challenges remain:

### 2.1 Current Challenges

The modern AI landscape is centralized and controlled by a few large corporations. This creates high barriers to entry, limits innovation, and leaves unused a vast pool of computational resources found in billions of smartphones worldwide.

| Challenge | Impact | Daur-AI Solution |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Centralized Control | Limited innovation, high costs | Decentralized network of smartphone nodes |
| High Computational Costs | Inaccessible to many developers | Pay-per-use model with lower costs |
| Wasted Resources | Billions of idle smartphones | Utilize existing devices as computational nodes |
| Data Privacy | Centralized data collection | Local processing with privacy-preserving techniques |
| Limited Access | Geographic and economic barriers | Global participation with minimal requirements |

## 3. Solution: Daur-AI

Daur-AI offers a revolutionary approach by transforming smartphones into nodes of a decentralized computational network. We use the concept of **Reverse AI** and a **Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)** consensus mechanism for efficient and secure task distribution.

### 3.1. Reverse AI

Unlike traditional AI, which goes from data to result, Daur-AI's reverse AI starts with the goal and works backward to find the optimal solution path. This allows complex tasks to be broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks that are ideal for a distributed network.

> "Reverse AI represents a paradigm shift in how we approach artificial intelligence problems. By starting with the desired outcome and working backward, we can efficiently distribute computational tasks across a network of devices, making AI more accessible and scalable." - Daur-AI Research Team

### 3.2. Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)

Instead of wasting energy on meaningless calculations (as in Proof of Work), nodes in the Daur-AI network perform useful work—solving real AI tasks. This makes our network not only secure but also extremely efficient.

Key benefits of PoUW include:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Up to 99% reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional PoW systems
- **Practical Value**: Every computation contributes to solving real-world problems
- **Fair Rewards**: Compensation based on actual computational contribution
- **Scalability**: System efficiency increases with more participating nodes

## 4. System Architecture

The Daur-AI system consists of the following key components:

### 4.1. Main Components

- **Main AI (MainAI)**: Strategic AI that analyzes, plans, and distributes tasks
- **Auxiliary AI (AuxiliaryAI)**: Specialized AIs on nodes that perform specific subtasks
- **Orchestrator**: Central component managing the task lifecycle
- **Decentralized Oracles**: Nodes that verify each other's work to ensure quality and security
- **TON Blockchain**: Used for task registration, result storage, and reward distribution

### 4.2. Technical Specifications

| Component | Technology | Function |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Mobile Node Client | React Native, TensorFlow Lite | Executes AI subtasks on smartphones |
| Orchestrator | Python, TensorFlow | Breaks down tasks, distributes subtasks |
| Smart Contracts | FunC (TON) | Manages task registry, payments, verification |
| MainAI | PyTorch, Transformers | Analyzes tasks, plans execution strategy |
| Oracle Network | Custom validation algorithms | Verifies computation results |

### 4.3. Workflow

The Daur-AI workflow follows these steps:

1. **User Request**: User submits an AI task request to the Daur-AI network
2. **MainAI Analysis**: Central AI analyzes and breaks down the task into smaller subtasks
3. **Task Distribution**: Orchestrator distributes subtasks to available mobile nodes
4. **Mobile Processing**: Smartphone nodes process assigned subtasks
5. **Oracle Verification**: Results are verified by oracle nodes for accuracy
6. **Result Aggregation**: Verified results are combined into the final output
7. **Reward Distribution**: DAUR tokens are distributed to contributing nodes

## 5. TON Blockchain Integration

Daur-AI leverages the TON blockchain for its high throughput, low transaction costs, and growing ecosystem. Current TON statistics demonstrate its capability to support our network:

- **Active Wallets**: 1.8+ million monthly active wallets [3]
- **Total Accounts**: 164+ million accounts [3]
- **Transactions per Day**: 1.8+ million [3]
- **Validators**: 340 validators securing the network [3]

### 5.1. Smart Contracts

Daur-AI implements several smart contracts on the TON blockchain:

- **Task Registry**: Manages task submissions, assignments, and completions
- **Token Contract**: Handles DAUR token transactions and rewards
- **Oracle Contract**: Verifies computation results and manages reputation scores
- **Governance Contract**: Enables community voting on protocol updates

## 6. Tokenomics

### 6.1. DAUR Token

The DAUR token is the native token of the network, used for computation payments, staking, and node rewards.

### 6.2. Token Distribution

![Tokenomics](/home/ubuntu/daur-ai-presentation-new/images/tokenomics_new.png)

- **Miners (40%)**: Rewards for smartphone nodes contributing computational resources
- **Network Development (30%)**: Ongoing development, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth
- **Investors (20%)**: Initial and future funding rounds
- **Team (10%)**: Core team allocation with vesting schedule

### 6.3. Economic Model

- **Deflationary Mechanism**: A portion of transaction fees is burned, ensuring long-term token value growth
- **Staking Benefits**: Node operators can stake DAUR tokens to increase their reputation score and earn higher rewards
- **Governance Rights**: Token holders can participate in protocol governance decisions
